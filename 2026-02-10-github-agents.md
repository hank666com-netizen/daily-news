Most AI agents run the same logic every time. Foundry is a self-writing meta-extension for OpenClaw (open-source agent framework) that:. 1. **Observes** your workflows — tracks goal → tool sequence → outcome. 2. **Researches** — queries docs, reads arXiv papers, writes code. 3. **Crystallizes** patterns into tools — when you've done something 5+ times with 70%+ success, it becomes a single command. 4. **Upgrades itself** — `foundry_extend_self` lets it write new capabilities into its own codebase. Behavior (self-written code) runs automatically, zero tokens. The Overseer runs hourly to auto-crystallize patterns, prune stale ones, and track tool fitness (ADAS-style evolution). This is operationalized recursive self-improvement — the system that writes the code IS the code being written. * Self-editing agents improve 17-53% (arxiv.org/abs/2504.15228). $FDRY token for marketplace payments (x402 protocol — HTTP 402 + Solana USDC).",
